        <h2>About Us!</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Formed in 2022, in the heart of Knoxville city, this band emerged from the depths of the
            underground music scene, driven by a shared vision to redefine the boundaries of metalcore. Since their
            inception, they have embarked on a journey marked by perseverance and evolution, where their electrifying
            sound and unbridled energy have masterfully captivated their audience. With every riff, bass note, drumbeat,
            and guttural scream, they deliver a thunderous musical experience.

            The musical influence of this band draws from both classic and contemporary metal, paying homage to groups
            like Erra, Currents, All That Remains, and Polaris.
